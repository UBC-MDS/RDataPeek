# Introduction to RDataPeek

Before any analysis can commence it is a good idea to understand your data.

- What is the structure of my data?
- Are there any missing values?
- What are common words in my qualitative data?  
- How does my quantitative data look like?

The RDataPeek package streamlines the answer to these questions:

- Providing you with a summary of your data
- Visualizing where your missing data is 
- Making a report-ready word bubble visualization 
- Presenting histogram(s) of quantitative data 

This Document introduces you to the RDataPeek’s basics and show you how to apply them to your .csv files. 

## Data: `example.csv`

As part of this vignette we have provided you with a custom sample of the typical company .csv file.

```{r, include = FALSE}
col_type <- readr::cols(
  A = readr::col_double(),
  B = readr::col_date(format = ""),
  C = readr::col_double(),
  D = readr::col_double(),
  E = readr::col_character(),
  F = readr::col_character(),
  movies = readr::col_character()
)

```

```{r}
readr::read_csv("example.csv", col_types = col_type)
```

## View Summary Statistics of Data
`RDataPeek::sample_data()` allows you to see a summary table of all your information in your selected .csv. “columns” give you the column name. “sample_record” provides you a random sample entry from the selected column. “data_type” provides with what type of data is in the column such as numeric, date or character. “summary” provides you with a summary statistic about that column. 

```
RDataPeek::sample_data("example.csv")
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
col_type <- readr::cols(
  X1 = readr::col_double(),
  columns = readr::col_character(),
  sample_record = readr::col_character(),
  data_type = readr::col_character(),
  summary = readr::col_character()
)
```

```{r}
readr::read_csv("0_summary.csv", col_types = col_type)
```


## Missing Data Overview

`RDataPeek::missing_data_overview()` provides you with a quick heat map of where your missing data or NAs are located in your .csv. Purple indicates where there is a value and yellow indicates where NA values are located. 

```
RDataPeek::missing_data_overview("example.csv")
```

```{r, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("_heatmap.png")
```

## Word Bubble 

`RDataPeek::word_bubble()` creates a unique word cloud out of responses in your qualitative data. The larger the word the more frequent it appeared!

```
RDataPeek::word_bubble("example.csv", column = "Review")
```
```{r, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("wordcloud.png")
```

## Explore_w_histograms

`RDataPeek::explore_w_histograms()` generates histograms for your selected quantitative columns. 

```
RDataPeek::explore_w_histograms("example.csv", columns_list = c("C", "D"))
```
```{r, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("C_chart.png")
```

```{r, out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("D_chart.png")
```
